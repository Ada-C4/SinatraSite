 * This file is located at "public/main.css" in your project directory.
 * Because it is in the "public" directory, Sinatra knows to make the file
 * accessible to your HTML files when you use the src="path/to/file"
 * attribute on the appropriate tags.
 *
 * To include an image into your site, place the file in the public directory
 * and use <img src="/name_of_image.png"> in your HTML file. The "public" part
 * of the path is not necessary.
